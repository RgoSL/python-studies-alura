### Exercise 1️⃣
Bruno manages a small business and wants to know which product performed better in sales last month. He recorded the number of units sold for two products: apples and bananas. Now, he needs to write a program that identifies and displays which one had higher sales.

Create a program that receives the sales numbers for both products and displays a message indicating which one sold more. If the quantities are the same, display a message saying there was a tie.

### Exercise 2️⃣
Camila is organizing a project and needs to calculate the total time required to complete three activities: A, B, and C. However, if any activity has a negative number of days, the code should warn that the entered values are invalid and should not calculate the total.

Write a program that receives the number of days for three activities and displays the total project time. If any value is negative, show an error message.

### Exercise 4️⃣
Anna Júlia is creating a system to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and provide basic recommendations. The program should receive a person’s weight and height and display the BMI value, as well as indicate whether the person is underweight, at a normal weight, or overweight.

Create a program that receives the weight (in kg) and height (in meters) and calculates the BMI using the formula:  
**BMI = weight / (height ** 2)**  

Then display the BMI value and a message indicating whether the person is underweight (BMI < 18.5),  
normal weight (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25), or overweight (BMI ≥ 25).

### Exercise 7️⃣
A teacher needs a program that helps calculate students’ final averages and informs whether they passed, need to take a recovery exam, or failed. The rules are:

- Average ≥ 7: Passed  
- 5 ≤ Average < 7: Recovery  
- Average < 5: Failed  

Write a program that receives three grades as input and calculates the final average. Based on the average, display the student’s status.

### Exercise 8️⃣
Fernanda is planning a trip and wants to calculate how much she will pay in toll fees. The toll value depends on the distance traveled:

- Up to 100 km: R$ 10.00  
- Between 100 km and 200 km: R$ 20.00  
- Over 200 km: R$ 30.00  

Create a program that receives the distance traveled and informs the corresponding toll fee.

### Exercise 🔟
Pedro wants to apply for a loan, but approval depends on two conditions:

- The monthly income must be greater than R$ 2,000.00.
- The installment amount must not exceed 30% of the income.

Create a program that receives Pedro’s monthly income and the desired installment amount as input. The program should inform whether the loan was approved or denied based on the conditions above.
