### 📇 Summary:
<hr>

### Exercise 1️⃣
Ana is developing a program that needs to process a list of 5 client names to generate monthly reports. To do this, she needs to write a program that iterates through the list of names and displays each client.

Help Ana decide between using a **for** loop or a **while** loop. Write the program using the loop you believe is most appropriate for this task and explain why you chose that loop.

### Exercise 2️⃣
André is testing a new backend feature in Buscante that processes data inside a loop. During testing, he noticed that the system stopped responding and suspects the issue is related to an infinite loop.

What is the problem with André’s code and how can it be fixed?

### Exercise 3️⃣
Marcos is developing a program to repeatedly display a welcome message in the console as part of a marketing campaign for his platform called Buscante. He wants to make sure the message is displayed exactly 5 times.

Help Marcos write a program that displays the message: **"Welcome to Buscante!"** the exact number of times he needs.

### Exercise 5️⃣
Ana is developing her portfolio to showcase the Python projects she has completed. She organized a list with the name of each project, but noticed that some items might be missing, appearing as `None`.

Create a program that helps Ana iterate through the list of projects and display the names of the valid projects. If a `None` item is found, the program should display the message: **"Missing project"**.

### Exercise 6️⃣
José is developing a feature in the Buscante system to stop a search as soon as a specific book is found. The list of books already registered in the system is provided.

Help José create a program that iterates through the list and displays the message **"Book found: <book name>"** as soon as the book **"The Hobbit"** is found. After finding the book, the program must immediately stop the search without checking the remaining books.

### Exercise 7️⃣
You are developing an inventory control system for Buscante. One of the requirements is to check the quantity of book copies in stock and continue selling until the stock runs out. Every time a sale is made, the system must notify the user and update the available quantity.

Create a program that simulates the sale of a book with an initial stock of 5 copies. The program should display the message **"Sale completed! Remaining stock: <quantity>"** after each sale and, at the end, display the message **"Out of stock"**.

### Exercise 8️⃣
Aline is implementing a feature that displays personalized messages for customers during a special promotion in her new bookstore. The system should display a customized countdown message for each number from 10 to 1, and at the end display the message: **"Take advantage of the promotion now!"**.

Create a program that uses a **for** loop to display the following messages:

- For even numbers, display: **"Only <number> seconds left – Don’t miss this opportunity!"**  
- For odd numbers, display: **"The countdown continues: <number> seconds remaining."**  

At the end of the countdown, display the message: **"Take advantage of the promotion now!"**.

### Exercise 9️⃣
Ana is implementing a book filtering system in Buscante. The feature should iterate through a list of books and display the name of each book that is available in stock. However, if a book is out of stock, it should be ignored during the iteration.

Create a program that helps Ana display only the books that have available stock, using the format: **"Available book: "**.

### Exercise 🔟
João is developing a registration system for a reading website. He needs to ensure that users enter a valid username and password. The rules are as follows:

- The username must have at least 5 characters.
- The password must have at least 8 characters.

João wants the system to keep requesting the information until both conditions are met. When the user enters valid data, the program should display the message: **"Registration completed successfully!"**.

Create a program that implements this logic using a **while** loop.
