### Exercise 9️⃣
You work in a library and are organizing book titles in the system. You need to identify all titles that contain words starting with a specific letter, in order to create thematic collections based on specific letters.

How would you create a program that asks for a text and an initial letter and returns all the words in the text that start with that letter?
